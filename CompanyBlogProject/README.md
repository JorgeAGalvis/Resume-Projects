# Company Blog Project

During my spare time in summer 2023, I took a Flask course to learn how the front-end and back-end communicate. 
The final project involved working on a multi-user company blog.

## Project Features: 

User Registration and Login: Allow users to create an account and log in using a username and password. <br>
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): Users can create new blog posts, view their own posts, edit their posts, and delete their posts.<br>
Basic Styling: Apply simple styling to the blog for a clean and attractive appearance.<br>
Home Page: Create a home page displaying a list of the most recent blog posts.<br>
Individual Blog Post Pages: Design pages to show individual blog posts with their full content.<br>
User Profiles: Display basic user profiles showing their usernames and a list of their created posts.<br>
Comments: Allow users to leave comments on blog posts.<br>
Responsive Design: Ensure the blog looks good and functions well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.<br>
About Page: Add a page with brief information about the company or the blog.<br>
